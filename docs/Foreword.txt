Nope, I won't translate it to russian. Too lazy, deal with it.

Hellow my fellow testers! Time to write some readme for this piece of garbage!
First of all: this is no magic thing that will make everything for ya. I worked on
it alone for almost a year, many (MANY) features I want to add are not implemented yet.
What this thing will do for you:
	If you're not coder and want some easy money:
	1. You'll be able to create some simple tasks with already predefined patterns
	2. You'll be able to pack these tasks into one pack without conflicts with anything
	
	If you're coder and want to outsource some of task complexity:
	1. You'll be able to create new task patterns
	2. You'll be able to configure most behaviours used by framework or use
	basic ones.
	
	If you're hardcore coder and want to upgrade framework itself:
	1. nothing. Don't. You'll lose your sanity.
	(but if you really want to, ping me in Discord, I'll give you some ideas)
	
What this thing WON'T do for you:
	1. Native dialog support is not implemented and won't be until much time later.
	2. Native questline support is not yet implemented. It must be easy to do for
	a coder tho, I just haven't done it yet.
	3. You can't get new behaviours without explicit coding. Nothing to see here.
	
I'll give some support in my discord (https://discord.gg/JSsVJWvZwD), but your main
source of information will be reverse-engineering of existing task packs. I won't
give support to stupid people. Fuck you.

With love,
Igi

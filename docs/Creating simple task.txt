So, you want to create a task. Rest in peace.

What do you need to do:
1. Write task description text
2. Write task json table
3. Connect your task to existing npc's through ltx files

Let's create some really basic fetch quest. Our task pack prefix will be "docs_".
Task_id will be "docs_fetch"
I'll leave tasks created for the sake of docs in the same docs folder

Part 1: Description text
Target folder: task_pack/configs/text/eng or rus
Create an xml file or copy-paste existing one. Name can be random, but I sugget to
start it with task pack prefix

We'll need to create entries for:
	title: title
	descr: Short task description (for PDA, tab, whatever)
	job_descr: Big task description (for dialog)
	finish: will be shown on completion
	
There's also two ways to define string id:
1. Task giver + task: id="igi_task_text_*npc_id*_task_*task_id*_*entry_label*"
2. Task: id="igi_task_text_*task_id*_*entry_label*"
first one is prefered.

Part 2: Task json
Target folder: task_pack/configs/igi_tasks/tasks
Create json file. Name must be the same as task_id

Put this text inside:
{
	"preconditions": {
	},
	"disabled":false,
	"setup": [

	{
	"entity_type":"item",
	"target":"fetch",
	"section":"underwear",
	"amount":1,
	"where":"anywhere",
	},

	],
}
How it works: see json_structure.txt

Part 3: ltx
For this part I've created taskmaker. Docs for taskmaker inside taskmaker folder.
You'll need python for this part, read how to start python scripts in google or whatever.
Create task folder through taskmaker, drop it into /configs/misc. Done.

Oh hey there! Ready to be a big boy? No you're not.

Example json from GT Task pack, transaction task.
{
	"preconditions": {
		"player_tier": "endgame",
	},
	"disabled":false,
	"setup": [
		{
		"where":"nearby",
		"entity_type":"smart",
		"target":"assault",
		},
		
		{
		"faction":"&Faction(enemy of taskgiver and enemy of actor)&",
		"section":"&TableValueByKey(gt_guard, $this.faction$)&",
		"entity_type":"squad",
		"to_create":true,
		"where":"$smart_1$",
		},
		
		{
		"faction":"&Faction(enemy of $squad_1.faction$)&",
		"online_activities":
			{"is_online":
				{"change_faction":"$squad_1.faction$"}
			},
		"section":"&TableValueByKey(gt_guard, $this.faction$)&",
		"entity_type":"squad",
		"to_create":true,
		"where":"$smart_1$",
		},
		
		{
		"entity_type":"item",
		"amount":2,
		"section":"&ChooseOne(gt_package_weapon,gt_package_artifact)&",
		"target":"return",
		"to_create":true,
		"where":"$smart_1$",
		"to_description":true,
		},
	],
}

Here's description by label:
precondition - defines conditions for getting this task
setup - defines entities of task. Entities are the task itself, without entities
task will constantly end since nothing to do.
	Entity types:
		smart - found or predefined if has smart_name field
		item - found or created, see examples in GT tasks
		squad - found or created, see examples in GT and BaseGame tasks.
		You may also define custom entity types.
		
	Field "target" defines, what must be done with this entity to finish task
	Field "online_activities" is basically useless for non-scripters and me too
	lazy to write advanced guide
	
reward - well... reward. May have two fields: "goodwill" and "money", both have number
as value. If you want to use dynamic rewards don't use this field.
